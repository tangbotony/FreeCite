We present **FreeCite**, a judge-free evaluation benchmark that reframes citation assessment as a deterministic **Context-Conditional Citation Prediction** task. By using a teacher-forcing strategy, FreeCite decouples citation logic from generation quality, ensuring deterministic and reproducible evaluation of citation placement. To support this paradigm, we introduce **LMCMark**, a rigorous, human-annotated dataset constructed from verifiable bilingual news sources and academic paper corpus. LMCMark contains over **40,000** validated citation markers across **5,858** query-response pairs, spanning **21** diverse topics in both English and Chinese.

We benchmark **20** LLMs and four citation pipelines on FreeCite. Experiments demonstrate that FreeCite achieves a high model-level Pearson correlation (**0.8431**) with human judgments, substantially surpassing baselines such as ALCE (0.4951) and LongCite (0.6308). Among the evaluated models, GPT-4-turbo (59.87%) maintains a significant lead, while leading open-source models like DeepSeek-v3 have effectively closed the gap with mainstream commercial counterparts. FreeCite also exposes critical failure modes like distractor sensitivity often masked by aggregated metrics. We release both the dataset and toolkit to advance verifiable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) research.

## Example test samples in the benchmark dataset

LMCMark is a rigorous, human-annotated bilingual dataset constructed via a three-stage pipeline (Source Collection, Response Generation, and Granular Annotation). It comprises **5,858** query-response pairs across **21** diverse topics (e.g., Law, Finance, Academia), containing over **40,000** verified citation markers covering both English (10,000 citations) and Chinese (30,418 citations). The dataset was curated by **27** expert raters over an intensive **45-day** annotation campaign, with each instance independently annotated by three raters and final labels determined by majority vote.

I would like to ask if you could elaborate on the specific details of the special inspections. If local enterprises are found to have failed to meet work safety standards, what forms of inspection, supervision, and penalties will the provincial and municipal-level Work Safety Commissions adopt? Thank you.\n[PZ77s6rS]: Next, the Ministry of Education will work with relevant departments to earnestly implement the Outline for Children's Development, making the promotion of coordinated education among schools, families, and society an important measure for implementing the central government's “double reduction” task, and will further focus on the following three areas of work:\nFirst, alignment in concepts. This is an important foundation for coordinated education.\n[kg8C45fw]: From 2011 to 2013, PetroChina's affiliated enterprises in Dalian experienced 5 accidents in three consecutive years, causing negative social impact. It has now been one year since the most recent fire accident on June 2, 2013. I would like to ask what lessons the relevant enterprises and departments have drawn from the accidents, and what the current status of rectification is. At the same time, the oil and gas pipeline explosion in Qingdao on November 22 last year also reminds us that urban safety operations are extremely urgent. What measures will the State Administration of Work Safety take in this regard? Thank you.\n[jnzBnPfJ]: We are currently studying the issue of tiered classification—which level should handle rectification at which level. For issues that enterprises can rectify on their own, some pipelines involve the government and urban planning, requiring government coordination. What enterprises can fix on their own is one tier; what can be fixed through government coordination is another; and for issues that neither the government nor enterprises can resolve, cross-provincial matters are escalated to the provincial level. If still unresolved, they are escalated to the State Council Work Safety Commission level. We regularly hold rectification coordination meetings.\n[QsC2LkNy]: The new Outline for Children's Development threads the central theme of “what kind of people to cultivate, how to cultivate them, and for whom to cultivate them” throughout, fully embodying the fundamental task of comprehensively implementing moral education and nurturing new generations who are well-developed morally, intellectually, physically, aesthetically, and in labor skills.\n[MvFlC3Hh]: We have launched the “Ten Thousand Cadres Dialogue with Ten Thousand Mine Directors” initiative. So far, we have held dialogues with over 7,700 mine directors. We plan to basically complete this initiative by the end of June, conduct a thorough summary of the work, and gradually institutionalize it. Through these dialogues, the awareness of mine directors regarding compliance and fulfilling their responsibilities has indeed been enhanced.\n[scviPG8N]: Regarding the third aspect, as we have now entered the rainy and flood season, what are the priorities for work safety? There are five priorities, given the special nature of the rainy and flood season. First, coal mines are the top priority. We have recently taken a combination of measures on coal mines, which is why we have seen sustained improvement—14 months without an extraordinarily severe accident. Because there is no smooth road to travel on the issue of coal mine safety; it is a rugged mountain path, and we must choose a reliable, four-wheel-drive, high-horsepower, high-powered off-road vehicle to move forward. We call this the “1+4” approach. “1” means earnestly implementing the General Secretary's speech, firmly holding the steering wheel—the direction must not go wrong: people-oriented, life above all, no GDP stained with blood, and no coal stained with blood—that is the direction. “4” refers to the dual seven regulations we formulated: the “Seven Regulations for Coal Mine Directors to Protect Miners' Safety,” called iron regulations with steel enforcement—full coverage, genuine implementation, and real results. Then there are the seven regulations for root-cause reform—the dual seven regulations are now being implemented at every mine nationwide. There is also warning education: the “Thousand Cadres Dialogue with Ten Thousand Mine Directors,” we selected the 50 counties with the most accidents, and our State Administration of Work Safety and Coal Mine Safety Administration go directly to the bottom level to conduct special management, which has proven quite effective. We are now focusing on implementation.\n[PLd2E6nd]: The new Outline for Women's Development emphasizes strengthening ideological and political guidance for women, promoting the normalization and institutionalization of education on ideals and beliefs, and guiding women to follow the Party's lead.

The complexity of the terrain causes cold air at night to intermingle with warm, moist airflow from the river surface, forming a vast sea of clouds at dawn. When the rising sun illuminates the sea of clouds, light dances and flickers between the cloud layers, presenting a scene of golden splendor that makes one feel as if in a dream[1JFRioBh].\n\n### Color Changes\nDuring the sunrise, the sky transitions from light blue and pink to orange-yellow, ultimately transforming into a brilliant gold. Under the illumination of the early sun, the sea of clouds gradually shifts from its initial silver-white to golden yellow, like nature's palette, shimmering with radiant and dazzling colors[1JFRioBh].\n\n### Sunrise Time\nThe sunrise time in the Xin'an River area varies by season, typically occurring between 6 and 7 AM. At this time, the temperature and environmental conditions are favorable for the formation of the sea of clouds and the perfect combination with sunrise light, making the golden moment when the sun first rises the best viewing time[1JFRioBh][fj4DeprJ].\n\n### Causes of Sea of Clouds Formation\nThe sea of clouds at Xin'an River is primarily formed by the convergence of cold air from the mountains and warm, moist air from the river surface. The mountainous terrain and climate further promote strong convective movements, producing multi-layered sea of clouds phenomena. The temperature difference in the river water also generates mist, further providing a foundation for the formation of the sea of clouds[1JFRioBh][nzhrFxMR][9elSeYvX].\n\n### Creation of Beautiful Scenery\nAt sunrise, sunlight penetrates through layers of clouds and mist, forming enchanting beams of light, as if on nature's stage of light and shadow. This light-and-shadow effect not only makes the sea of clouds mysterious but also showcases the dynamic beauty of undulating waves in the wind, making the entire process full of artistic color and visual impact[1JFRioBh][fj4DeprJ].\n\n### Appeal to Tourists\nThe sea of clouds and sunrise at Xin'an River has become an important natural spectacle attracting tourists from around the world. Photography enthusiasts are drawn by the unique natural scenery and light-and-shadow effects here, traveling thousands of miles to photograph and document this stunning visual experience. Visitors enjoy the magnificent sea of clouds and sunrise while savoring the tranquility and poetry that nature brings[1JFRioBh][9elSeYvX].\n########",

After the torrential downpour, the sunset glow filled the sky. These two days, the riverside and rooftops have become excellent spots for photography enthusiasts to click their shutters. Having seen enough sunsets, the editor today brings a different set of scenery: morning mist. In summer, the Xin’an River quietly unfolds a cool painting scroll resembling a fairyland. At dawn, in Xiaya Town, Jiande City, mist pervades the river surface and mountains. In the morning light, our photographer friend Ge Yuejin captured this series of “splash-ink landscape paintings.” On rainy days, there is more water vapor in the mountains. Old Ge said he set out from Jinhua, and it’s not far to Xiaya—driving through Lanxi to Jiande takes less than two hours.. “Stay overnight the day before, wake up early the next day, go to the riverside, and you can start shooting around 6 AM.” The editor learned that the mist also occurs in winter here, but it’s less prominent than in summer. Old Ge told the editor that in the past, many photographers went to photograph fishermen casting nets on the river surface. “Now transportation is convenient, and you can go to many places. Photographing the daily life of villagers along the shore gives a more humanistic feel,” Old Ge said. His only regret was not bringing a drone before this trip. The whole area looks like a landscape painting, he said. Along the river there are docks, villages across the water, and spots where people wash clothes—all photographable.   “People who come here to take photos include not only locals from Zhejiang, but also photography enthusiasts from Jiangsu, Shandong, and Fujian.” Old Ge also said that when shooting, use a smaller aperture; besides close-up shots, distant views are also beautiful.   So where does the fairyland-like mysterious river fog come from? Old Ge also gave the editor a lesson.   It turns out that the Xin’an River maintains a year-round water temperature of 17°C, creating a temperature difference with the air above. In the early morning and evening, one can see the misty Baisha (White Sand) magical fog scenery. -\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-◆◇◇◇◆-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-   Using good photos to tell good stories is what we have always been doing.

May 18, She County, Anhui. Continuous rainy weather widened the day-night temperature difference in the southern Anhui mountain area, revealing a high-altitude sea of clouds spectacle over the Xin'an River. Rolling mountain ranges were surrounded by river water and sea of clouds, resembling a natural ink wash painting scroll. Editor: Li Rui. Proofreader: Ding Xiao\n[vZfmhcHG]: Where mountains are high and waters run long, there is Xin'an. A spring emerges from mountain streams, passes through rapids, flows into the Xin'an, joins the Qiantang, and surges mightily toward the East Sea. The Xin'an River, winding like a ribbon, has flowed for a thousand years, enlivening the landscape, settling into character, nourishing the people of Xin'an County, and nurturing the unique Xin'an culture—much like the rugged mountains and gentle waters of the Xin'an land. What is Xin'an? Where is Xin'an? How has the light of Xin'an culture, enduring for millennia, illuminated the ancients and inspired the people of today? We attempt to find out. To find the stunning moments after a thousand years of dust settled on tiles and steles, to find the traces left by Cheng Yuantan and Shang Lu through historical time and space, to find the lingering fragrance of a medical classic or a tea treatise after a thousand years of vicissitudes, transforming that fragrance into the scent of ink—they are all in the flowing river waters. Drops become rivers, rivers merge into seas, forming a river of culture flowing from ancient times to the present, with each splash of waves carrying the vitality of cultural Zhejiang, shining with the bright light of cultural confidence. They are in everyone's heart.\n[8BQ8XbfG]: The Fuchun River Has Stored Water for Over 50 Years, Earning Its Reputation as a Natural Fish Reserve—Why Does It Share the Same Plight as Qiandao Lake?: Through investigation, experts and scholars reached two important conclusions: First, across different monitoring cross-sections, algae consistently showed high density at the surface and low density at deeper levels. At the Mamu Bridge cross-section, the surface algal content was the highest, with chlorophyll concentration reaching 18μg/L, due to the influence of Fuchun River backflow, which led to nutrient enrichment and localized algal accumulation and reproduction. At the bottom of the cross-section, the water mainly originated from flood discharge of the upstream Qiandao Lake reservoir, with low water temperature and low phytoplankton density, and chlorophyll concentration generally not exceeding 3μg/L. Second, the surface water of the Fuchun River mainly comes from the Lan River, which has high nutrient content and serious nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. The nutrient-rich surface water was retained in the reservoir in the form of reciprocating flow, forming large backwater areas that provided favorable conditions for algal growth, with algal density continuously increasing, ultimately leading to algal blooms.\n[eF7FTXFi]: Viewing the Sea of Clouds at Taizi Peak—Why Is It Especially Popular This Year?: After 7 AM, the mountain top still had too much moisture, presenting conditions similar to light drizzle, with very low visibility under the thick cloud and fog.        "Sigh—we all checked professional weather apps before setting out, and they said we could see the sea of clouds around 7, but the micro-climate in the mountains is uncontrollable and inaccurate. We can't see it again today..." Ms. Tao was quite disappointed, saying candidly that viewing the sea of clouds is a matter of probability, truly a case of "man proposes, heaven disposes."        Ms. Tao's companions did not give up. They brought out drones for aerial photography and finally broke through the sea of clouds at about 300 meters above the summit, capturing the breathtaking spectacle of the sea of clouds and sunrise. However, for those standing on the mountain top, they were unable to enjoy this scene.\n[IyAkrgbi]: The Fuchun River Has Stored Water for Over 50 Years, Earning Its Reputation as a Natural Fish Reserve—Why Does It Share the Same Plight as Qiandao Lake?: The nutrient-rich surface water was retained in the reservoir in the form of reciprocating flow, forming large backwater areas that provided favorable conditions for algal growth, with algal density continuously increasing, ultimately leading to algal blooms. At this point, the true cause of the Fuchun River algal bloom was finally identified: both the input of nutrients and the special backflow zones caused by hydrodynamic factors worked together to provide a "hotbed" for the proliferation of harmful algae. How many silver carp and bighead carp need to be released to solve the Fuchun River algal bloom? From an ecological perspective, solving algal blooms is not complicated—as long as there are sufficient numbers of filter-feeding fish such as silver carp and bighead carp in the reservoir, they can produce a top-down effect through their feeding behavior, ultimately keeping algal density in check. The top-down effect is an ecological term defined as: the biological influence transmitted from higher to lower levels along the food chain. In other words, the top-down effect can be understood as the influence that higher trophic level fish have on lower trophic level algae, both promoting and constraining.\n[dOg2KE2S]: [Red Memories of China's Rivers and Lakes] Walking in a Bright Mirror, Birds Crossing a Painted Screen—Chronicles of the Xin'an River: Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai wrote in his poem "Qingxi Xing" (Journey on Clear Stream): "Walking in a bright mirror, birds crossing a painted screen," expressing the clarity of the river water. Shen Yue's "Xin'an River So Clear and Shallow That the Bottom Can Be Seen, Sent to Friends in the Capital" described the crystal clarity of the Xin'an River: "Transparent with the shallow clarity, a bright mirror regardless of winter or spring. Thousand-fathom cliffs reflect tall trees, ten-thousand-zhang depths reveal swimming fish." Regardless of depth, irrespective of season, the river water is always as clear as a mirror—even in the deep waters, one can see tall trees and swimming fish. The Xin'an River is not only blessed with clear waters and beautiful mountains but also has a long history, many famous figures, and numerous cultural relics and historic sites. Chun'an and Jiande were the ancient Muzhou prefecture. This land nurtured famous Tang Dynasty poets such as Fang Gan, Huangfu Shi, and Huangfu Song, as well as Song Dynasty zhuangyuan (top scholar) Zhan Kui and Fang Fengchen, and Ming Dynasty Prime Minister Shang Lu who achieved the rare triple-first in imperial examinations. Since the Song Dynasty, the two counties of Chun and Sui produced a total of 341 jinshi (successful candidates in the imperial examinations)[3]. Chun'an has always valued education and established academies.\n[Z45zDIzD]: [Report from the Yangtze River Economic Belt] Xin'an River: Practicing the "Two Mountains" Concept: Behind the two provinces' water quality "compact" lies their shared pursuit of ecological priority and green development. Now, after two rounds of pilot programs, the regular consultation, joint monitoring, joint salvage, joint enforcement, and emergency coordination mechanisms between the upstream and downstream of Anhui and Zhejiang provinces have become routine. The diversified, risk-sharing, reward-and-punishment-oriented ecological compensation mechanism has also become increasingly mature, and the ecological environment of the Xin'an River has been significantly improved. "We can see that the Xin'an River is getting cleaner and more beautiful day by day," Wu Bengao told reporters. "More and more tourists are coming to visit the Xin'an River and enjoy the beautiful scenery along the river." 2. Recreating the "Landscape Gallery" At the local maritime affairs office in Shendu Town, She County, Director Huang Yijun spread out a blueprint. "This is the renovation blueprint for the ship domestic sewage collection system. After the renovation, wastewater generated from toilets, bathrooms, washrooms, kitchens, and other areas will be centrally collected and treated onshore, achieving 'zero discharge' of ship sewage in the Xin'an River basin.\n[UsmxRlec]: Viewing the Sea of Clouds at Taizi Peak—Why Is It Especially Popular This Year?: Heaven and earth possess great beauty without speaking of it, and Lin'an has "four beauties" that are inexhaustible!    These newly crowned "four major outdoor internet-famous check-in spots" are: the mist of Taizi Peak, the green of Qingshan Lake, the snow of Baizhang Ridge, and the stars of Qianniu Ridge, harboring the natural charm of "Outdoor Paradise • Vibrant Lin'an."        The so-called "mist of Taizi Peak" is also the "sea of clouds" that has gone viral online.    Whether born in the 60s, 70s, 90s, or 2000s, no one can resist the spectacular sight of winds and clouds surging and rolling at the 1,557-meter summit of Taizi Peak, like the ocean raising thousand-layered waves crashing against the shore—especially the thrilling moment at sunrise, facing the morning sun and sea of clouds, waving the five-starred red flag on the mountain top, the magnificent rivers and mountains of the motherland so beautiful they bring tears to one's eyes.\n[wXtL2ngT]: Zhejiang: On July 5, a photographer captured the romantic summer sunrise clouds at the Xin'an River in Zhejiang. At the moment the sun rose, the sea of clouds surged, golden light cascaded down, and the entire sea of clouds was bathed in rays of golden light—breathtakingly beautiful.

In the East of the world, there is a land meticulously sculpted by nature—Zhejiang. Here, the mountains are beautiful, the rivers are dynamic, and the Xin'an River is a magnificent wonder in this splendid landscape. Recently, the sea of clouds and sunrise at Zhejiang's Xin'an River have woven together a breathtaking scene, attracting the enthusiastic attention of numerous photography enthusiasts and travelers.

Convergence of Time and Space: The Geographic Code of Xin'an River. Zhejiang's Xin'an River, located in the western part of Zhejiang Province, originates from the Huangshan mountain range in Anhui Province. Since ancient times, it has been one of the important water sources in the Jiangnan water region. This approximately 373-kilometer river is renowned for its rippling blue waves and crystal-clear water quality. The magnificent spectacle of the sea of clouds and sunrise is a natural wonder jointly nurtured by Xin'an River's unique geographic location and climate conditions. [Time] Sunrise is nature's solemn daily ceremony. When the sun first rises and the first ray of light pierces through the night, all things awaken in the morning glow, symbolizing hope and renewal. The sunrise at Xin'an River, enhanced by its encounter with the sea of clouds, adds an extra touch of mystery and fantasy. To capture this moment, many photography enthusiasts brave the heat and cold, waiting early by the riverside, just to witness the magnificent scene of golden light breaking through dawn and clouds swirling. [Space] The terrain of the Xin'an River basin is complex, with undulating mountains and a humid climate. The river surface is at a relatively low elevation, surrounded by mountains, forming a natural passage for warm and humid airflow. At night, cold air from the mountains slides down the slopes and converges with the warm, moist airflow above the river surface, producing strong convective movements that form a vast sea of clouds. When the morning sun rises, golden light penetrates the cloud layers and falls upon the earth. The sea of clouds transforms endlessly under the sunlight, resembling a golden ocean, magnificent and spectacular. II. Light and Shadow Magic: The Artistic Interpretation of Sea of Clouds and Sunrise.

When the first ray of sunlight pierces the sky, the sea of clouds is instantly illuminated, transforming from deep gray to silver-white, then gradually to golden yellow, like a giant palette showcasing nature's magical power. [Flowing Light and Shadow: The Dance of Sea of Clouds and Sunrise] As the sun rises higher, sunlight casts long shadows on the sea of clouds, creating alternating light and dark effects. The sea of clouds surges and undulates in the wind, dreamlike and fantastical, as if dancing with the rising sun. Sunlight streams through gaps in the clouds, forming beams of light like sacred radiance cast by divine hands, giving people a sense of solemnity and sanctity. III.

Three hundred and sixty rapids, Xin'an is in the sky." vividly portrayed the rugged terrain features of Xin'an River.

The Survival Strategy of Huangshan's Unique Pines! In Huangshan, the Most Wonderful Thing Is Still Viewing the Clouds! "Made in Huangshan"—How Much Do You Know?: The Qiantang River basin has many mountains and few plains. The terrain gradually rises from northeast toward the southwest and surrounding watersheds. The source of the Qiantang River is the eastern slope of Liugujian in Xiuning County, southeastern Anhui—this is its northern source, the Xin'an River (main source; southern source—Lan River). After joining the Lan River, it flows northeast to below Ganpu in Haiyan County, Jiaxing, and empties into Hangzhou Bay (East Sea). The ancient famous Huangshan Mountain possesses the "Four Wonders": unique pines (the Huangshan Greeting Pine, rooted on sheer cliffs through biological weathering and wedge-splitting action), grotesque rocks (the mountain body is mostly composed of granite, formed under crustal uplift and external forces, especially through spheroidal weathering), sea of clouds (formed by low clouds and ground fog—high mountains and low valleys, lush forests, short sunshine hours, high humidity, and abundant moisture), and hot springs (formed by rainwater seeping into rock joints and cracks in well-developed mountain bodies, absorbing geothermal heat).\n[nzhrFxMR]: Jiande's Unique "Water Wonderland"!

Baisha Bridge. Xin'an River: The Legend of 17°C. Jiande Beautiful Rivers and Lakes Classic Case. The Xin'an River originates within Huangshan City, Anhui Province, enters western Zhejiang Province to the east, passes through Chun'an (Qiandao Lake) to Jiande where it merges with the Lan River to become the Tongjiang section and Fuchun River section of the Qiantang River mainstream, flowing northeast into the Qiantang River. So the Xin'an River, Fuchun River, and Qiantang River are actually different sections of the same river. "Above is heaven, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou"—as the upper reaches of Hangzhou's Qiantang River, the Xin'an River is also called "the entrance to paradise." Rainbow Bridge @Zhu Yongbiao. The water of the Xin'an River comes from the bottom of Qiandao Lake, flowing out through the majestic dam of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station, winding east around the city, miraculously maintaining a constant temperature of 12~17°C year-round—this is the legend of the 17°C Xin'an River water. At night along the Xin'an River bank, waiting for the fog to rise, slowly flowing on the river surface, sometimes leaping onto Baisha Bridge and Rainbow Bridge, walking among them feels like strolling through a fairyland.

Introduction: The spread of “sleep debt” among young people — trapped in the night, how do they support the hundred-billion-yuan “sleep economy”? The fast-paced lifestyle of modern society seems to push young people to keep up “day and night.” For the post-90s and post-00s generation, “sleep debt” is becoming an inescapable norm. On one hand, they strive for work and life, with nighttime becoming one of the few moments that belong to themselves. On the other hand, sleep problems follow, with surging demand for various sleep-aid products and services, driving the “sleep economy” to gradually become an emerging market worth hundreds of billions.\n[MKjSVGLi]:Why Are More and More Young People Choosing to “Lie Flat”? An In-Depth Analysis of the Reasons Behind It:Although this lifestyle can relieve pressure in the short term, in the long run, it is detrimental to personal development. 2. Impact on Society. A large number of young people choosing to “lie flat” will have a certain impact on socioeconomic development. The decline in social productivity and the shrinking of the consumer market are issues that cannot be ignored. At the same time, society also needs to reflect on how to provide better development environments and opportunities for young people, and reduce their motivation to choose “lying flat.” Society needs to make adjustments in policies and systems to relieve the pressure on young people and provide them with more development opportunities and support. For example, providing more protections and support in housing, employment, education, and other areas to reduce the pressure on young people, thereby lowering the likelihood of them choosing to “lie flat.”\n[m73HZgnN]:“Trapped” in the Night, “Enriched” by the Sleep Economy — Young People's Sleep Debt and Market Redemption:In this issue, the post-00s have become the “main force” of nighttime activities, accounting for 45.7%. Data shows that young people who are busy with work during the day often find it difficult to fall asleep early at night. The “free time” at night becomes the only moment they can enjoy after daytime fatigue, filled with extensions of personal entertainment needs: binge-watching shows, reading, gaming, or late-night social activities — all of this seems to have become a “habit.” However, this nighttime “release” of freedom comes with an obvious cost: accumulating “sleep debt” day after day. Under long-term pressure, insufficient sleep has had significant impacts on the brain, nervous system, and physical and mental health. The shrinkage of neuronal cells, memory decline, and the risk of anxiety and depression have risen significantly.\n[0cFX0stS]:“Trapped” in the Night, “Enriched” by the Sleep Economy — Young People's Sleep Debt and Market Redemption:In the view of some experts, long-term reliance on daytime “catch-up sleep” may mask health problems, especially among young people. Those who rely on catch-up sleep to offset the sleep debt caused by staying up late at night often find it difficult to break this habit, forming a vicious cycle. The root cause of this condition lies in circadian rhythm disruption and over-reliance on short-term catch-up sleep, rather than a genuine lifestyle change. Sleep experts suggest that instead of placing hopes on various catch-up sleep methods, it is better to try to establish a healthy sleep routine and ensure high-quality sleep at night, in order to truly alleviate sleep debt at its root. V. The Tug-of-War Between Commerce and Health: The Future Path of the Sleep Economy. In the ongoing development of the sleep economy, various products and services are emerging endlessly, and young people's choices are continuously expanding. However, behind the prosperity of this market, quite a few problems have also arisen. First, product effectiveness varies greatly.\n[xr4EDEoN]:Coffee: Does It Really Refresh the Mind or Deplete Energy?:For heavy coffee dependents, due to long-term coffee consumption, the body's tolerance to caffeine increases, and drinking coffee no longer causes discomfort, while not drinking coffee actually feels uncomfortable. This is due to the addictive nature caused by consuming large doses of caffeine or long-term coffee drinking, also known as "caffeine intoxication." Once discontinued, without caffeine binding to adenosine receptors, the large amount of adenosine accumulated in the body takes effect, causing withdrawal symptoms such as lethargy and general weakness. Consuming more than 400mg of caffeine at once may lead to excessive stimulation and anxiety, and bring symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, nausea, or abdominal pain. Over-reliance on caffeine to boost spirits may also numb perception, ignoring the body's strong signals for rest, leading to excessive fatigue. Therefore, it is very necessary to clearly know your own tolerance level for caffeine.\n[1hsw3s6b]:Adolescent and Young Adult Health:However, it is estimated that only 12% of girls worldwide were vaccinated in 2021.

Early pregnancy and premature childbearing. In developing regions, approximately 12 million girls aged 15-19 and at least 777,000 girls under 15 give birth each year.

AFP photo. [Global Network comprehensive report] According to Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao on May 25, in New York, more and more young people choose to rent “sleep pods” to rest and relieve fatigue during lunch breaks when feeling tired during office hours, rather than drinking coffee or energy drinks. As living standards improve, Americans are increasingly health-conscious, constantly pursuing the latest “health trends” such as green juices, hot yoga, and matcha. Some businesses have seized market demand and launched “sleep pods” similar to capsule hotels, allowing customers to pay for naps. “NapYork,” located near Penn Station in New York, is one of the emerging businesses offering sleep pod services. Tired customers can sleep in wooden pods at any time for $12 per half hour (approximately 16.5 RMB). When NapYork opened 3 months ago, it offered only 7 pods, but due to overwhelming demand, they added 22 pods within just a few months. Soon, hammocks will also be installed on the building's rooftop, allowing customers to rest for $15 per half hour (approximately 95.6 RMB). The company's marketing director, Wilori, said: “We just want to give all tired New Yorkers a place to rest. Finding a peaceful and tranquil place in this city is really not easy.” According to reports, many Americans face the problem of insufficient sleep. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 3 Americans does not get enough sleep. A survey by Siena College shows that only 24% of New Yorkers get 8 hours or more of sleep, and about 50% sleep only 6 hours or less. But insufficient sleep can lead to low mood, decreased productivity, and poor concentration. (Intern editor: Zhou Simin; Reviewer: Tian Ruizhe) Return to Sohu, see more.

However, young people have varying attitudes toward these sleep-aid products — some endorse the sleep-aiding effects the products bring, while others harbor doubts about their effectiveness. The reasons lie, on one hand, in the uneven quality of market products, with many ineffective or over-advertised products; on the other hand, sleep-aid products are essentially just “auxiliary tools,” and the key to truly improving sleep quality still lies in changes to routines and lifestyle. III. Divergence in Consumption: Polarized Reactions to Sleep-Aid Products. Alongside the booming development of the sleep economy, young people's mindset when consuming sleep-aid products shows significant polarization. Some young people firmly choose to try various sleep-aid products and services, hoping they will bring “quick results” improvement.\n[xoOVHfrF]:“Trapped” in the Night, “Enriched” by the Sleep Economy — Young People's Sleep Debt and Market Redemption:Some young people firmly choose to try various sleep-aid products and services, hoping they will bring “quick results” improvement. Typical examples include the “4-7-8” breathing method, listening to hypnotic music (such as "Weightless"), etc., which are believed to help people fall asleep quickly. For this group, sleep-aid products can bring psychological “comfort” and even become a tool to enhance the ritualistic feeling of sleep. Another group of young people, however, holds a skeptical attitude, believing that the effectiveness of sleep-aid products is debatable and the prices are relatively high. Particularly with sleep-aid devices and smart sleep products, young people are more cautious. They believe these products can hardly fundamentally solve sleep debt — treating symptoms but not the root cause. For these young people, truly effective “sleep redemption” should involve adjusting the biological clock, reducing late nights, and appropriately relaxing the body and mind in daily life.\n[mXhYGuoN]:“Trapped” in the Night, “Enriched” by the Sleep Economy — Young People's Sleep Debt and Market Redemption:However, behind the prosperity of this market, quite a few problems have also arisen. First, product effectiveness varies greatly. Some low-cost, low-quality products flood the market, raising consumer concerns about safety and effectiveness. Second, young people's over-reliance on sleep-aid products and services may cause them to overlook fundamental adjustments to their routines. In the future, the development of the sleep economy should move toward “diversification” and “standardization.” Businesses should provide more scientifically-based products through innovative technology, rather than blindly pursuing “sleep-aid” effects. In addition, the government and market regulators should further standardize the sleep economy market, ensure product quality compliance, and prevent unscrupulous businesses from taking advantage. For young consumers, the key to truly improving sleep quality lies in improving lifestyle habits, planning time reasonably, and finding relaxation methods that suit themselves.\n[kd6mqWTQ]:Both Can Refresh You, So Why Do I Strongly Recommend Energy Drinks Over Coffee?:A functional beverage practitioner here to speak from experience!!! First, you need to understand how coffee and energy drinks each provide their refreshing effects! Coffee's refreshing effect comes from caffeine, which can disguise itself as adenosine (the source of drowsiness) and bind to adenosine receptors, inhibiting the real adenosine. However, once the caffeine is metabolized out of the body, adenosine and adenosine receptors reunite. At that point, you'll still feel drowsy when you should! Rather than saying coffee refreshes you, it's more like depleting your energy. (Or borrowing energy in advance.) Energy drinks' refreshing effect mainly relies on the combination of caffeine and taurine. Unlike coffee, the taurine in them accelerates the body's metabolism and enhances supply — like a CPU in a computer that runs more efficiently and with fewer errors when cooled down. Simply put, it refreshes you while also helping you focus more, improving work efficiency! You could say coffee provides short-term refreshment, while taurine can provide long-term energy for the body!!! Common energy drinks on the market like Red Bull, Tiger, Monster, Lipovitan, etc., differ in their caffeine, taurine, and sugar content!!! Among them, I most recommend Lipovitan! Each bottle has 1000mg of taurine, and the sugar content per bottle is also the lowest. Both its refreshing ability and anti-fatigue ability are excellent. Brothers who easily feel drowsy or who work out can go for this one!https://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/5f4e46665c1319eed77f28fd24773a71?BIZ=ECOMMERCEOf course, if we judge solely by taurine content, that's far from enough!! [First point: Low caffeine content, gentler and longer-lasting refreshing effect] Caffeine essentially tricks our nervous system, forcing us to perk up. If consumed in large quantities over a long period, the body adapts to caffeine and develops tolerance, causing the brain to release fewer adenosine receptors. Before, one cup would keep you alert all day; now you might need a whole bucket. At this point, caffeine intake must be reduced! Compared to other functional beverages on the market, Lipovitan's caffeine content is only 20mg per bottle, making it one of the lowest among functional beverages, with a gentler and longer-lasting refreshing effect!! Most importantly, you don't need to worry about excessive caffeine intake! [Second point: Sufficient taurine content, transforming the body from the inside out] Taurine plays important functions in maintaining our physical health, such as enhancing myocardial contraction, combating anxiety, improving visual function, promoting fat metabolism, lowering blood sugar, eliminating fatigue, etc. However, taking a healthy adult as an example, the taurine synthesized by the liver only accounts for 30-40% of what is needed, so exogenous taurine intake is necessary! One bottle of Lipovitan contains 1000mg of taurine, which fully meets daily needs! But even so, we shouldn't chug it like cola! According to regulations, the maximum daily intake of taurine is 6g, so the maximum is six bottles per day! In terms of ingredients, Lipovitan is the king of value — you should know that similar beverages with 1000mg of taurine added cost several times more!https://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/5f4e46665c1319eed77f28fd24773a71?BIZ=ECOMMERCE[Third point: Low sugar, healthier] Actually, whether it's coffee or functional beverages, they contain not only caffeine but also a lot of sugar!!! If you consume a large amount of sugar, it will be quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and blood sugar will rise rapidly. If you have to stay up late for work, you can choose ones with less sugar — Lipovitan is a great choice. Many of my friends around me are drinking Lipovitan. Whether they're office workers or fitness enthusiasts, they all think Lipovitan is healthier than coffee and provides longer-lasting refreshment! From a long-term perspective, eating a Snickers bar versus eating ginseng definitely has different effects, and long-term Lipovitan drinkers versus long-term coffee drinkers are certainly different too! Strongly recommending to all brothers who get drowsy during overtime and love fitness — link is here, help yourselveshttps://xg.zhihu.com/plugin/5f4e46665c1319eed77f28fd24773a71?BIZ=ECOMMERCEBefore I knew it, I've typed so many words. I'll stop here — brothers, take good care of your bodies!

Nicotine is highly addictive, and young people's brain development continues until around age 25. Tobacco fact sheet. E-cigarettes: How risky are they? Mental Health. Depression and anxiety are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is one of the leading causes of death among people aged 15-19. Half of all adult mental disorders begin by age 14, but most cases go undetected or untreated. Many factors affect the well-being and mental health of adolescents. Violence, poverty, humiliation, exclusion, and living in humanitarian and fragile settings increase the risk of mental health problems. Adolescent mental health fact sheet. Infectious diseases. HIV. An estimated 1.7 million adolescents (aged 10-19) were living with HIV in 2021, approximately 90% of whom were in the WHO African Region.\n[eRrnH582]:Ensuring the Health and Well-being of Today's Adolescents Is Vital for the Health of Future Generations — WHO:WHO website homepage/Press releases/item/Ensuring the health and well-being of today's adolescents is vital for the health of future generations — WHO. According to a new scientific publication released by the World Health Organization (WHO), there is an urgent need to increase investment to address changing health risks and meet the mental, sexual, and reproductive health needs of nearly 1.3 billion adolescents (aged 10-19) worldwide. Adolescence is a unique and critical stage of human development, involving significant physical, emotional, and social transitions, and is a key window for laying a long-term foundation for good health. “Promoting and protecting the health and rights of young people is essential for building a better future,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Conversely, failing to address the health threats facing adolescents — some long-standing, some emerging — will not only have serious and life-threatening consequences for young people themselves, but will also impose a heavy economic burden on society. Therefore, investing in adolescent health services and programs is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity.” The publication was launched at an event during the UN Summit of the Future. The report highlights some concerning trends observed over the past decade in adolescent health, noting the urgent need for action. For example, at least one in seven adolescents globally currently has a mental disorder, with particularly high rates of depression and anxiety. Anemia in adolescent girls remains prevalent, at levels similar to 2010, while nearly one in ten adolescents is obese. Sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes, commonly occur among young people and their numbers are rising. If left untreated, they can have lifelong health effects. At the same time, violence, including bullying, affects millions of young people globally each year, with devastating effects on their physical and mental health. Against a backdrop of growing pushback against gender equality and human rights, attempts to restrict adolescents' access to sexual and reproductive health services and comprehensive sexuality education are intensifying. Policies restricting age of consent limit their access to STI and HIV services. These measures can marginalize young people, reduce health-seeking behavior, and lead to lasting negative health effects. The study highlights other broader underlying challenges adolescents face in the future, including climate change, conflict, and inequality. The authors also emphasize that progress is possible with the right investments and support. For example, adolescent HIV infection rates have declined due to coordinated and sustained efforts in this area. Teen pregnancies and harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage have decreased. In addition, positive trends in many health outcomes are associated with more time spent in school, especially for girls; since 2000, the number of out-of-school children of secondary school age has fallen by nearly 30%. In this context, the research findings make a strong case for investing in adolescent health and well-being, with a focus on fundamentals such as education, health care, and nutrition. The authors call for the development and implementation of laws and policies that protect adolescent health and rights, enable health systems and services to better meet the unique needs of adolescents, and prioritize youth participation and empowerment in research, planning, and policy-making. “When adolescents are able to set the agenda for their own well-being and future, they are powerful and highly creative forces for good,” said Rajat Khosla, Executive Director of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH), which co-hosted the publication launch. “Leaders must listen to young people's needs and ensure they become active partners and decision-makers. They are critical to the social, economic, and political stability of the world's future, and if given the platforms they need, they can help create a better, healthier world for everyone.” Earlier this year, world leaders at the World Health Assembly committed to accelerating efforts to improve maternal and child health, including adolescent health. Fulfilling these commitments, as well as those embodied in the UN Pact for the Future, is critical to protecting and promoting the health and well-being of current and future generations. Editor's Note: The publication was launched at a high-level event held during the UN General Assembly. The event was co-hosted by the Governments of Chile, Colombia, and Ireland, along with the UN Human Reproduction Programme, the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH), and WHO, with partners including: FP2030, the Guttmacher Institute, the International Association for Adolescent Health (IAAH), Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHUSPH), Plan International, UNESCO, UNFPA, Women Deliver, and YieldHub. The Summit of the Future will be held on September 22-23, 2024, to seek new consensus on how the international system can evolve to better meet the needs of current and future generations.

An In-Depth Analysis of the Reasons Behind It:After seeing discussions about the “lying flat” phenomenon in the media, many young people feel they are not alone and have gained more psychological support. The spread of this culture has made the “lying flat” phenomenon increasingly common among young people. VI. The Far-Reaching Impact of the “Lying Flat” Phenomenon. 1. Impact on Individuals. Young people who choose to “lie flat,” while able to relieve pressure and gain psychological calm in the short term, may in the long run face stagnation in personal development and alienation in social relationships. How to find a balance between “lying flat” and active pursuit is a question every young person needs to consider. “Lying flat” is not merely an escape from external pressure but also a relinquishment of self-development. Long-term “lying flat” may cause individuals to lose their drive and goals, gradually losing competitiveness in their careers and lives. Although this lifestyle can relieve pressure in the short term, in the long run, it is detrimental to personal development.\n[xjsiA2o7]:Adolescent and Young Adult Health:Drowning fact sheet. Violence. Interpersonal violence is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents and young adults globally. Its significance varies markedly by region. In low- and middle-income countries in the WHO Region of the Americas, nearly one-third of male adolescent deaths are due to interpersonal violence. Adolescent violence also increases risks of injury, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, mental health problems, poor academic performance and school dropout, early pregnancy, reproductive health problems, and communicable and non-communicable diseases. Adolescent violence fact sheet. Alcohol and drug use. Adolescent drinking is a serious problem in many countries. Worldwide, more than a quarter of 15-19 year-olds currently drink alcohol, equivalent to 155 million people. In 2016, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among 15-19 year-olds was 13.6%, with males at highest risk.\n[ohZ8z0QA]:“Trapped” in the Night, “Enriched” by the Sleep Economy — Young People's Sleep Debt and Market Redemption:On the other hand, sleep problems followed, with surging demand for various sleep-aid products and services, driving the “sleep economy” to gradually become an emerging market worth hundreds of billions. So what are the deep-seated factors supporting the booming development of the sleep economy? And how do young people find balance in this tug-of-war between “economy and health”? I. Overdrawn “Free Time”: The Current State of Young People's Sleep Debt. Over the past decade, more and more young people have gone from “insomnia problems” to a state of “sleep debt.” According to data from the "2024 China Residents' Sleep Health White Paper," “difficulty falling asleep” has become the main sleep concern for post-80s, post-90s, and post-00s groups. In this issue, the post-00s have become the “main force” of nighttime activities, accounting for 45.7%. Data shows that young people who are busy with work during the day often find it difficult to fall asleep early at night.\n[7biKj0J3]:The Truth About Coffee's “Mind-Refreshing” Effect: Not Sustaining Life but Depleting Energy? This Debt Must Eventually Be Repaid! The Best Way to Refresh Turns Out to Be...:However, no matter how much caffeine is consumed, adenosine does not disappear into thin air but still exists outside the cells. After the caffeine is metabolized, these adenosine molecules will “seize the opportunity” and successfully bind to receptors, making the feeling of drowsiness come back even more intensely. As molecular nutritionist Emma Beckett stated, coffee does not provide you with extra energy — this feeling of being “refreshed” is more like a “loan.” “The debt you owe your brain must always be repaid. In fact, there is only one true way to repay it, and that is 'sleep'!” The correct way to drink coffee — although it's “depleting,” you still need to drink it when the time calls for it.\n[TxIzpNiZ]:Why Are More and More Young People Choosing to “Lie Flat”? An In-Depth Analysis of the Reasons Behind It:Many students, in addition to their coursework, also need to participate in various extracurricular activities and social practices, which fills their lives with pressure and anxiety. After long-term exposure to this high-pressure environment, many young people choose to “lie flat” after entering society, to escape this high-pressure state. 2. The Influence of Media and Culture. Media plays an important role in shaping young people's values. In recent years, online discussions about “lying flat” have increased, with many articles and videos exploring the rationality and feasibility of the “lying flat” phenomenon. Through media dissemination, more and more young people are influenced by this culture, choosing to “lie flat” to resist life's pressures. The media has not only spread the “lying flat” culture but also, to a certain extent, rationalized this lifestyle. After seeing discussions about the “lying flat” phenomenon in the media, many young people feel they are not alone and have gained more psychological support.\n[ljMnCVka]:Have an Exquisite Nap!

An In-Depth Analysis of the Reasons Behind It:Long working hours and excessive pressure leave many young people feeling physically and mentally exhausted, longing to escape this high-pressure lifestyle. Unfair practices in the workplace are also an important reason why young people choose to “lie flat.” Many people find that no matter how hard they try, opportunities for promotions and raises often still fall into the hands of a few. This unfair workplace environment causes them to lose confidence and motivation for the future, choosing to “lie flat” to avoid futile struggles. 3. Social Expectations. Society's expectations of young people also invisibly increase their pressure. Traditional notions hold that young people should have a stable job, buy a house, get married, and have children before age 30. However, the reality is often that they face enormous challenges in finance, work, personal life, and other areas, making it difficult to meet these expectations. Long-term struggles between these high expectations and real-life pressures have led many young people to choose “lying flat.”\n[JQ2tBhjQ]:Adolescent and Young Adult Health:In 2016, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among 15-19 year-olds was 13.6%, with males at highest risk. Cannabis is the most widely used psychoactive drug among young people; in 2018, approximately 4.7% of 15-16 year-olds had used it at least once. Alcohol and tobacco use among children and adolescents is associated with neurocognitive changes that can lead to behavioral, emotional, social, and academic problems later in life. Alcohol fact sheet. Tobacco use. Today, the vast majority of smokers begin smoking during adolescence. In 2018, at least one in ten 13-15 year-olds globally used tobacco, and in some regions, this figure is much higher. E-cigarette use among children and adolescents is particularly dangerous. Nicotine is highly addictive, and young people's brain development continues until around age 25.\n[8zsuunzx]:“Trapped” in the Night, “Enriched” by the Sleep Economy — Young People's Sleep Debt and Market Redemption:For these young people, truly effective “sleep redemption” should involve adjusting the biological clock, reducing late nights, and appropriately relaxing the body and mind in daily life. IV. Paid Daytime Napping: Relief or Concealment? Paid daytime napping is becoming a “healing remedy” for some young people. They choose to pay at hotels or lounges to enjoy “high-quality” sleep, offsetting the sleep missed at night. Especially in first-tier cities, “short-term paid napping” services during midday breaks or work breaks are highly sought after, and some companies even provide employees with private rest rooms or short rest services. This paid napping approach can superficially relieve fatigue but cannot fully mask deeper health problems. In the view of some experts, long-term reliance on daytime “catch-up sleep” may mask health problems, especially among young people.\n[kGiIXCUj]:“Trapped” in the Night, “Enriched” by the Sleep Economy — Young People's Sleep Debt and Market Redemption:The shrinkage of neuronal cells, memory decline, and the risk of anxiety and depression have risen significantly. Scientific research shows that long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of depression and anxiety by more than 1.4 times compared to the general population — this is undoubtedly a health hazard under long-term “debt.” II. The Rise of the Sleep Economy: From Aromatherapy Pillows to Smart Technology. Against the backdrop of “insomnia and anxiety,” sleep-aid demand has gradually been segmented into different scenarios and products, rapidly developing into a hundred-billion-scale “sleep economy” market. In 2023, China's sleep economy market reached 495.58 billion yuan, with a year-on-year growth of 8.6%. Data from iiMedia Consulting shows that this market will continue to grow steadily in the coming years.\n[YBEVvpMo]:“Trapped” in the Night, “Enriched” by the Sleep Economy — Young People's Sleep Debt and Market Redemption:The true “redemption” lies in young people's own lifestyle changes and their emphasis on health and life rhythm. The sleep economy may be the market's response to young people's life dilemmas, but in the long run, healthy sleep habits are the fundamental solution that young people need. After all, sleep is not a task that can be “paid to complete,” but rather an indispensable health safeguard for young people facing future challenges.\n[P9rNjZvR]:Why Are More and More Young People Choosing to “Lie Flat”? An In-Depth Analysis of the Reasons Behind It:Long-term struggles between high expectations and real-life pressures have led many young people to choose “lying flat.” Society's high expectations are reflected not only in career and financial terms but also in expectations for personal life. Young people are expected to achieve dual success in both career and family in a short period of time, and this pressure makes them feel overwhelmed. Especially when facing marriage and family issues, many young people find they simply cannot balance career and family at the same time, so they choose to “lie flat” to escape this dual pressure. III. The Growing Prominence of Mental Health Issues. 1. Anxiety and Depression. In a high-pressure living environment, more and more young people are facing anxiety and depression. Whether it's uncertainty about the future or dissatisfaction with the current situation, mental health problems are becoming a widespread phenomenon. Behind “lying flat” is often young people's helpless compromise on mental health — they hope to alleviate inner anxiety and pain by reducing pressure and responsibilities.\n[FSwAiDZv]:Coffee: Does It Really Refresh the Mind or Deplete Energy?:However, this increased heart rate and cardiac arrhythmia are not the same concept. Heart experts worldwide are still investigating the relationship between caffeine and cardiac arrhythmia. Currently, there is no definitive research showing that caffeine causes cardiac arrhythmia. Institutions such as the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology agree that moderate coffee consumption by adults — approximately 1-2 cups per day — does not increase the risk of heart disease and cardiovascular disease. However, cardiovascular disease patients carrying the PDSS2 gene have slower caffeine metabolism than normal people and lower tolerance, and should proactively limit caffeine intake. Based on current meta-analyses, moderate caffeine does not promote the occurrence of cardiovascular disease, but with the advancement of scientific research, there are still many questions waiting for scientists to investigate and answer.\n\n[7XVjjA2f]:Is Drinking Coffee for an Energy Boost Outdated? New York's Young People Rent “Sleep Pods” to Catch Up on Sleep:Is Drinking Coffee for an Energy Boost Outdated? New York's Young People Rent “Sleep Pods” to Catch Up on SleepSource: China Daily Network. 2018-05-26 15:20:59. China Daily Network, May 26 — According to Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao on May 25, more and more young New Yorkers no longer drink coffee or energy drinks when feeling tired during office hours, but instead rent “sleep pods” to recharge during lunch breaks. Currently, affluent Americans are increasingly health-conscious, constantly pursuing the latest “health trends” such as green juices, hot yoga, and matcha. Some businesses have seized market demand and launched “sleep pods” similar to capsule hotels, allowing customers to pay for naps. “NapYork,” located near Pennsylvania Station in New York, is one of the emerging businesses offering “sleep pod” services. Tired customers can sleep in wooden pods at any time for $12 per half hour (approximately 77 RMB). When NapYork opened 3 months ago, it offered only 7 pods, but due to overwhelming demand, they added 22 pods within just a few months. Soon, hammocks will also be installed on the building's rooftop, allowing customers to sleep facing the sky for $15 per half hour (approximately 96 RMB). The company's marketing director, Stacy Velorick, said: “We just want to give all tired New Yorkers a place to rest. Finding a peaceful and tranquil place in this city is really not easy.” Indeed, many Americans face the problem of insufficient sleep. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 3 Americans does not get enough sleep. A survey by Siena College shows that only 24% of New Yorkers get 8 hours or more of sleep, and about 50% sleep only 6 hours or less. Insufficient sleep can lead to low mood, decreased productivity, and poor concentration. 28-year-old Laura is an editor at a travel company. Every week, she goes to the luxury spa-style “Yelo Spa” across from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York for a 35-minute nap. Laura's sleep pod is a hexagonal cockpit that looks like something from a science fiction movie. She lies in the pod on a bed suspended in zero gravity, with her feet elevated to lower her heart rate and promote sleep. “I choose to come here to sleep and recharge when work is particularly heavy... Some people think it's a waste of time or money, but I think as long as I can afford it and feel refreshed after sleeping, that's enough.” (Editor: Yan Yujie) Tags: Coffee, New York, Sleep Pod.

        "prompt": "<im_user>\nYou are a journalist. Your task is to write a specific chapter section of a \"Two Sessions\" (NPC & CPPCC) live dispatch article based on the given subtitle, using the designated reference materials.\nThe subtitle of the chapter you need to write is: \"Maternal and Child Health Levels and Traditional Chinese Medicine Service Capabilities Continue to Improve\" \n\nI will provide you with some reference materials. Please write this chapter based on the content of the reference materials, ensuring smooth writing, appropriate wording, no distortion of facts, comprehensive citation of all reference materials, and thorough news writing.\n\nReference materials:\n[xK5DLN54]: Focus on challenging issues such as childhood myopia, obesity, and birth defects, as well as cervical and breast cancer in women, implement a series of practical and effective special actions, improve the full life-cycle service model, and promote the comprehensive development of women's and children's health.\n[deMYbGcE]: I have two questions: First, Director Fu just mentioned the coal mine accident in Turkey, the ferry sinking accident in South Korea, and the tunnel explosion accident in Shanxi, plus the coal mine dewatering accident that occurred not long ago in Yunnan. What lessons should be learned from the rescue efforts in these accidents? Second, we understand that the revision of the \"Work Safety Law\" has entered the practical operation stage and has been submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for discussion. Before this, the revision had already solicited opinions from various parties. What are the main areas these opinions focus on? Thank you.\n[xcfoxyN2]: The losses of coal mining enterprises mentioned earlier are mainly due to oversupply. Our country's coal production last year was 3.7 billion tons, with oversupply and excess capacity. In reality, we don't need that much coal, but we still produce that much. Without sufficient demand, prices drop; when prices drop and costs rise, enterprises inevitably suffer losses. However, we have both concerns and opportunities to leverage from these losses. The opportunity lies in reorganizing and closing small coal mines. As Comrade Jianhua mentioned, we should take advantage of the current market oversupply and excess capacity, where some coal mines are suffering severe losses, which is even more pronounced for small coal mines. We want to intensify the reorganization and closure of small coal mines — some should simply stop operating. The risks are high and losses severe, so why continue? Closing them also ensures safety. The disadvantage is that enterprise losses mean safety investment is not guaranteed, which is a concern. We must now do everything possible to educate enterprises that whether profitable or not, they cannot neglect safety investment. Neglecting it will create hidden dangers and problems, so safety investment must be maintained.\n[rVQVe71o]: Thank you, Director Yang. Director Yang gave a comprehensive introduction, especially regarding the important measures taken in work safety this year, which is very helpful to us. Please go ahead with your questions, and please state your news organization when asking.\n[SO2tlvp4]: Since the beginning of the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" period, with the implementation of the \"Maternal and Infant Health Care Law,\" the \"Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests,\" and the China Women's and Children's Development Outline as the core, we have consolidated and improved the service system, continuously optimized health services, and successively implemented a series of action plans including maternal and infant safety, healthy children, and maternal and child TCM development, continuously enhancing the sense of fulfillment of women and children, with health levels steadily improving.\n[Ujj6USLT]: As of the end of 2022, county-level TCM medical institution coverage reached 87.78%, with 40,674 TCM clinics nationwide, and 99.5% of community health service centers and 99.4% of township health centers able to provide TCM services. In the next step, our bureau will work with relevant departments, leveraging the implementation of the major project for the revitalization and development of TCM, to further advance the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" action plan for enhancing grassroots TCM service capabilities, expand the effective supply of grassroots TCM talent, carry out TCM urban-rural counterpart assistance work, improve the standardization of grassroots TCM services, and continuously enhance the accessibility, equity, and convenience of TCM for the general public.\n[ZSwTmOp5]: In the next step, our bureau will work with relevant departments, leveraging the implementation of the major project for the revitalization and development of TCM, to further advance the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" action plan for enhancing grassroots TCM service capabilities, expand the effective supply of grassroots TCM talent, carry out TCM urban-rural counterpart assistance work, improve the standardization of grassroots TCM services, and continuously enhance the accessibility, equity, and convenience of TCM for the general public.\n[rG4bSVAv]: Here are some figures: In 2022, China's maternal mortality rate was 15.7 per 100,000, the infant mortality rate was 4.9‰, and the under-5 mortality rate was 6.8‰, all dropping to historically low levels and ranking among the top of upper-middle-income countries.\n[4smbCfnD]: We will continue to \"ensure safety, address challenges, and promote development\" to effectively safeguard the health rights of women and children. On one hand, focusing on the major health issues of women and children on the demand side, we will continuously optimize maternal and child health services, consolidate and improve the maternal and infant safety assurance system, and firmly uphold the bottom line of maternal and infant safety.\n[nQjxGXlv]: Currently, the country has established a TCM service system covering the provincial, municipal, county, and township levels, adequately meeting the TCM service needs of urban and rural residents. As of the end of 2022, county-level TCM medical institution coverage reached 87.78%, with 40,674 TCM clinics nationwide, and 99.5% of community health service centers and 99.4% of township health centers able to provide TCM services.\n[2KlDl1Z2]: The most effective measures are taken to create a strong atmosphere for work safety. I won't elaborate. I feel that work safety must focus on publicity and education, including the dissemination of safety knowledge, enhancing safety awareness — it is everyone's responsibility, everyone's duty, and everyone's concern. With the joint efforts of journalists, the results in this area have been quite good.\n[H5GKf3kI]: Director Dongliang just reported on the national coal mine safety production situation this year. As of May 20, a total of 190 coal mine accidents occurred nationwide, resulting in 319 deaths. This year's national coal mine safety production situation can be summarized as the \"four declines.\" First, the total number of accidents has declined — as Director Dongliang just reported, the total number of accidents decreased by over 30% year-on-year. Second, major and extraordinary accidents have declined — the number of such accidents and related deaths decreased by over 60% year-on-year compared to last year. Third, significant accidents have declined, with a year-on-year decrease of over 20%. Fourth, the coal mine death rate per million tons has declined — from January to April this year, the national rate was 0.227, a year-on-year decrease of over 30%.\n[ufiKqFI4]: On the other hand, with strengthening the maternal and child health service system construction as the main focus, advance the upgrading of the maternal and child health service system, coordinate and leverage multiple resources, address shortcomings and weaknesses, and accelerate the goal of \"having one government-run standardized maternal and child health care institution at each provincial, municipal, and county level.\" Please observe the following guidelines:\n1. You need to insert citation source IDs in the answer, formatted as [ID]. Try to place the IDs as close as possible to the cited information, rather than only at the end of sentences, but within punctuation marks. Do not use expressions like \"materials,\" \"[XXX] indicates,\" or \"based on [XXX]\" in the text — simply mark the citation source. For example: \"Although similar lawsuits were filed, they were all dismissed[5JYWMo1U], and Trump's legal team stated they would appeal to the Federal Supreme Court[UUmzrEIn].\"\n2. Ensure the correspondence between the chapter content and the subtitle \"Maternal and Child Health Levels and Traditional Chinese Medicine Service Capabilities Continue to Improve,\" as well as logical consistency and fluency.\n3. When quoting individuals' viewpoints, do not add to or splice the reference information — preserve the original wording of the quoted speech.\n4. Use full names when mentioning individuals for the first time (rather than he/she), provide explanations for proper nouns, and give absolute dates when mentioning time.

## To evaluate your models with our evaluation framework, please follow the steps below.

### 1. Clone the project repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flozxwer/FreeCite
```

### 2. Set up the environment

- Ensure you have Python 3.9.0+
```bash
conda create -n freecite python=3.12 -y 
conda activate freecite
```

- install requirement
```bash
cd FreeCite
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### 3. Enter the main experiment scripts directory

```bash
cd ./main_scripts
```

### 4. Model inference 

We provide two methods for model inference: (1) for open-source models, download the models locally for inference running; (2) for non-open-source models, use the official APIs for inference running.

#### a. Open-source models: local model inference

Make sure to set the correct input(`url`, `model_name`, `fname`, `filename_`).

- `url` is the interface that invokes the model stored locally
- `model_name` is the model to generate the citations
- `fname` is the path to the original data file
- `filename_` is the path to store the response data

Run the following command for model inference：

```bash
python citation_try_code.py
```

#### b. Closed-source models: model inference with the official APIs

##### Supported models

'Baichuan4-turbo', 'Doubao-1.5-pro-32k', 'Moonshot-v1-32k', 'DeepSeek-v3', 'Claude-opus-4.5-thinking', 'Gemini-2.0-flash', 'Gemini-2.5-flash', 'GPT-5', 'GPT-4-turbo', 'GPT-4o', 'GPT-4o-mini' from OpenAI

##### Configure the API key

Configure the Key of the preceding model in main_scripts/api_large_experiment.py(No need to add "Bearer")

```bash
key_dict={
    "gpt": "key",
    "baichuan":"key",
    "moonshot": "key",
    "doubao": "key",
    "deepseek_v3":"key",
    "glm":"key",
    "claude":"key",
    "gemini":"key"
}
```

Make sure to set the correct input(`model_name_here`, `fname`, `filename`).

- `model_name_here` is the model to generate the citations
- `fname` is the path to the original data file
- `filename_` is the path to store the response data

Run the following command for model inference：

```bash
python api_large_experiment.py
```

#### c. English data experiments

##### Supported models

Both 'Open-source models' and 'Closed-source models'.

##### Configure the API key

Configure the Key of the preceding model in main_scripts/api_large_experiment_eng_data.py(No need to add "Bearer")

```bash
key_dict={
    "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": "",
    "gpt-4-turbo": "",
    "gpt-4o-mini": "",
    "deepseek": "",
    "moonshot": "",
    "doubao": "",
    "deepseek_v3":"",
    "glm":"",
    "baichuan":"",
    "qwen":"",
    "claude":"",
    "gemini":""
}
```

Locate the `models` variable in 'run_open_models_eng.bash' and modify its list of model names. Execute the script with the command:

```bash
bash run_open_models_eng.bash
```

Or you can run the following command：

```bash
python citationtry_code_eng_data.py --model_name"$model"
```

#### d. Experiments based on variable seeds

##### Supported models

Both 'Open-source models' and 'Closed-source models'.

##### Configure the API key

Configure the Key of the preceding model in main_scripts/api_large_experiment_confidence_interval.py(No need to add "Bearer")

```bash
key_dict={
    "gpt-4o-2024-08-06": "",
    "gpt-4-turbo": "",
    "gpt-4o-mini": "",
    "deepseek": "",
    "moonshot": "",
    "doubao": "",
    "deepseek_v3":"",
    "glm":"",
    "baichuan":"",
    "qwen":"",
    "claude":"",
    "gemini":""
}
```

To run this, edit the collection of `model_name` and `seeds` in 'run_api_model_confidence_interval.sh' and then execute the script.

```bash
bash run_api_model_confidence_interval.sh
```

Or you can run the following command：

```bash
python api_large_experiment_confidence_interval.py --seed "$seed"--model_name "$model_name"
```

For the model names, refer to the keys in the `model_name_dict` defined at the beginning of the code. 

### 5. Evaluation

Run the following command to evaluate your generations, and aggregate the final results.

Make sure to set the correct input(`model`, `f_res`, `og_file_path`).

- `model` is the model which generated the citations
- `f_res` is the path to the generations data file
- `log_file_path` is the path to store the resulting statistics

```
cd ..
cd statistics_scripts
python model_result_stats.py
```

The evaluation of the English data results is performed by 'model_result_stats_eng.py', which follows the same usage methodology as the code used for evaluating the Chinese data results.

## Running Experiments for ALCE and LongCite

The code for `ALCE` and the `LongCite` section is adopted from the original source code. We have made the following changes based on the source code：
- For `ALCE`, add the `flask_api` and `custom_api` parameters and their corresponding `generate_via_flask` and `generate_via_custom` methods in the `run.py` file. This enables both general API calls and HTTP calls to a remote Flask service. Additionally, define the `eos_mapping_dict` to specify different model stop tokens. Modify the logic of `use_chat_api` to add recognition for `gpt-4o`. In the `eval.py` file, the original code directly used the locally loaded T5 model for NLI inference (in the `_run_nli_autoais` function). This has been changed to call a remote NLI service via an HTTP API. At the same time, the final file saving format has been changed to `.txt` files.

- For `LongCite`, the `llm_api.py` file contains logic to determine and assign different APIs and keys based on the model type, while also modifying the request headers.In `pred_one_shot.py`, an `is_open` parameter has been added to facilitate future determination of whether a model is open-source, as the message formats for the two model types are different. Additionally, truncation processing has been implemented for the return data from open-source models.

### ALCE Experiment Steps
1. **Run Model-Specific Bash Scripts**  
   Execute the bash script corresponding to each model. These scripts are located in the ALCE_code directory. For example:
   
   ```bash
   bash ALCE_code/run_Llama3.3_70B_configs.bash
   ```
   This script will start the inference process of the specified model (Llama3.3_70B) by calling the YAML files in the configs directory of ALCE. The YAML files are written based on the YAML files from the original thesis's GitHub repository.

2. **Sampling results**  
   After running the model script, sample 100 data for each result to obtain a manageable dataset for evaluation using the following script.

   ```bash
   python pick_100.py
   ```
   The sampling results are located at [LMCMark Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/flozxwer/LMCMark).  

3. **Run Evaluation Script**  
   Finally, run the evaluation script to evaluate the performance of the model. The evaluation script is called `eval.py`:
   
   ```bash
   python ALCE_code/eval.py --f {path/to/100data/file} --citations --no_rouge
   ```
### LongCite Experiment Steps
1. **Sampling results**  
   Sample 100 data for evaluation.

   ```bash
   python sample.py
   ```
   
2. **Run Prediction Script**  
   Execute the `pred_one_shot.py` script to generate predictions using the prepared 100 data samples. The script is located in the `LongCite_code` directory:
   
   ```bash
   python LongCite_code/pred_one_shot.py
   ```
   This script will process the input data and generate prediction results.

   *In the `cite_model` field, enter the corresponding model name, and in the `is_open` field, enter the Boolean value of whether it is an open source model. If it is an open source model, enter `True`, otherwise enter `False`.*

3. **Run Evaluation Script**  
   After generating the prediction results, run the `eval_cite.py` script to evaluate the performance. The script is located in the `LongCite_code` directory:
   
   ```bash
   python LongCite_code/eval_cite.py
   ```
   The script will provide the evaluation results.

   *Fill in the absolute path of the prediction result file in the `pred_paths` of the file.*

## Experimental setting/details
The parameters in "The evaluation of ALCE" and "The evaluation of LongCite" are the ones used when the model generates prediction results. The remaining parameters for evaluating the model's prediction results and obtaining scores are all referenced from ALCE and LongCite respectively.

1. **The evaluation of FreeCite**  
    Both the main experiments and the manually annotated data were run with a temperature of 0. Additionally, the maximum token length for the main experiments was set to 20.
   
2. **The evaluation of ALCE**  
    The open-source models were configured with a temperature of 1.0, a top p value of 0.95, and a maximum token limit of 300. The closed-source model settings included a temperature of 0.5, a top_p value of 1.0, and a maximum token limit of 300.
   
3. **The evaluation of LongCite**  
    Both open- and closed-source models were configured with a temperature of 1.0 and a maximum token limit of 1024.
